# Business card experiment

## Mechanical

- Battery holder for CR2016 batteries using 3 PCBs
    - inner pcb is 1.6mm, outer pcbs are 0.8mm
    - all components on bottom pcb
    - cutouts for components on inner pcb and hole for battery
    - retainers for battery on top pcb (will need experimentation)
- PCBs soldered together with large vias and pad on bottom pcb
       - 4mm pad on bottom pcb
       - 4mm via on inner pcb
       - 5mm via on top pcb
       - 6 vias (corners and middle of long side)
## First proto - flashlight
- CC led driver
- leds on one end using C409529 or C965866 side mounted LEDs (also look for UV version)
- 2 x CR2016
- C842736 for LED driver
- C256108 for button
